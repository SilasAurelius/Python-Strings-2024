# Task 1: Keyword Highlighter: Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

# Task 2: Sentiment Tally: Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.

# Task 3: Review Summary: Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
